# FB-Messenger-chatbot
A simple chatbot for facebook messenger that I made in a fairly short time. Expect really bad code and shortcuts. 

# How to use
This doesn't use the official Facebook API, it uses fbchat which basically makes it run in a browser(You just don't see it.)
To use, replace the user_ids and thread_id in the script and you should be basically good to go. You can get your user_ids by running the fetch_id script.
WARNING: Don't spam messages too much, facebook might ban you. I'm not responsible if that happens.
# Dependacies
pip install fbchat
